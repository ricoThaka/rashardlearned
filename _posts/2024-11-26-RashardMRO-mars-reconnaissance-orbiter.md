The planet Mars has two permanent polar ice caps of water ice and some dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide, CO2). Above kilometer-thick layers of water ice permafrost, slabs of dry ice are deposited during a pole's winter,[1][2] lying in continuous darkness, causing 25–30% of the atmosphere being deposited annually at either of the poles. When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO2 sublimes.[3] These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds.

File Formats
============

   All text documents and other meta information files such as
   descriptions, PDS object definitions and detached PDS labels are
   stream format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line
   feed character (ASCII 10) at the end of the record.  This allows the
   files to be read by MS-DOS/Windows, Unix and MacOS operating
   systems.

   The data files in this data set were prepared to be used under a
   UNIX environment. Therefore all SPICE text kernel files are UNIX
   text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10) at the end of the
   line, and all SPICE binary kernels files are UNIX binary files in
   which bit pattern structures for double precision and integer
   numbers follow the IEEE standard. While some of the data files on
   this volume can be used 'as is', converting the files to binary or
   text format native to the user's computer may be required. Refer to
   the documentation provided with the SPICE Toolkit to find out
   whether conversion is needed in each specific case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. For access to this
   tool, see the reference to the NAIF utilities website in the file
   ``/software/softinfo.txt''.

# Chronology of discoveries of water on Mars
To date, interplanetary spacecraft have provided abundant evidence of water on Mars, dating back to the Mariner 9 mission [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_discoveries_of_water_on_Mars)
# [MRO](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-reconnaissance-orbiter-mro/) files to explore issues i wont ignore!
    MISSION_OBJECTIVES_SUMMARY  = "

  The driving theme of the Mars Exploration Program is to understand the
  role of water on Mars and its implications for possible past or
  current biological activity.  The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
  Project will pursue this 'Follow-the-Water' strategy by conducting
  remote sensing observations that return sets of globally distributed
  data that will:  1) advance our understanding of the current Mars
  climate, the processes that have formed and modified the surface of
  the planet, and the extent to which water has played a role in surface
  processes; 2) identify sites of possible aqueous activity indicating
  environments that may have been or are conducive to biological
  activity; and 3) thus identify and characterize sites for future
  landed missions. 
  
  The MRO payload is designed to conduct remote sensing science
  observations, identify and characterize sites for future landers, and
  provide critical telecom/navigation relay capability for follow-on
  missions.  The mission will provide global, regional survey, and
  targeted observations from a low 255 km by 320 km Mars orbit with a
  3:00 P.M. local mean solar time (ascending node).  During the one
  Martian year (687 Earth days) primary science phase, the orbiter will
  acquire visual and near-infrared high-resolution images of the
  planet's surface, monitor atmospheric weather and climate, and search
  the upper crust for evidence of water.  After this science phase is
  completed, the orbiter will provide telecommunications support for
  spacecraft launched to Mars in the 2007 and 2009 opportunities.  The
  primary mission will end on December 31, 2010, approximately 5.5 years
  after launch.


  Science Questions Addressed
  ---------------------------

    The MRO mission has the primary objective of placing a science orbiter
    into Mars orbit to perform remote sensing investigations that will
    characterize the surface, subsurface and atmosphere of the planet and
    will identify potential landing sites for future missions.  The MRO
    payload will conduct observations in many parts of the electromagnetic
    spectrum, including ultraviolet and visible imaging, visible to
    near-infrared imaging spectrometry, thermal infrared atmospheric
    profiling, and radar subsurface sounding, at spatial resolutions
    substantially better than any preceding Mars orbiter.  In pursuit of
    its science objectives, the MRO mission will:

    - Characterize Mars' seasonal cycles and diurnal variations of water,
      dust, and carbon dioxide.
    - Characterize Mars' global atmospheric structure, transport, and 
      surface changes.
    - Search sites for evidence of aqueous and/or hydrothermal activity.
    - Observe and characterize the detailed stratigraphy, geologic 
      structure, and composition of Mars surface features.
    - Probe the near-surface Martian crust to detect subsurface structure, 
      including layering and potential reservoirs of water and/or water ice.
    - Characterize the Martian gravity field in greater detail relative to 
      previous Mars missions to improve knowledge of the Martian crust and 
      lithosphere and potentially of atmospheric mass variation.
    - Identify and characterize numerous globally distributed landing sites 
      with a high potential for scientific discovery by future missions.

    In addition, MRO will provide critical telecommunications relay
    capability for follow-on missions and will conduct, on a
    non-interference basis with the primary mission science, telecom and
    navigation demonstrations in support of future Mars Exploration
    Program (MEP) activities.  Specifically, the MRO mission will:
    
    - Provide navigation and data relay support services to future MEP
      missions.
    - Demonstrate Optical Navigation techniques for high precision delivery 
      of future landed missions.
    - Perform an operational demonstration of high data rate Ka-band 
      telecommunications and navigation services.

    Designed to operate after launch for at least 5.4 years, the MRO
    orbiter will use a new spacecraft bus design provided by Lockheed
    Martin Space Systems Company, Space Exploration Systems Division in
    Denver, Colorado.  The orbiter payload will consist of six science
    instruments and three new engineering payload elements listed as
    follows:

    Science Instruments
    - HiRISE, High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment 
    - CRISM, Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars
    - MCS, Mars Climate Sounder
    - MARCI, Mars Color Imager
    - CTX, Context Camera
    - SHARAD, Shallow (Subsurface) Radar
    
    Engineering Payloads
    - Electra UHF communications and navigation package
    - Optical Navigation (Camera) Experiment
    - Ka Band Telecommunication Experiment
    
    To fulfill the mission science goals, seven scientific investigations
    teams were selected by NASA.

# Dear Mro

Jamie Mantel/SenBillNelSon,

I dont know if you are still alive(jamie). I went to the Team Meeting for the Ecostress Instrument and got removed by Hotel Faculty! I went ontime and everythign! The people did not defend me. IDK what is p with the country bc im scared. I lost Coral! and Erika is  [Prosituted in Los Angeles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAOwmcdLvek) well sold for, she was always sensitive intimately so i know she wanted to go someplace where she felt stable psychologically. I was supposed to go to Arcadia for a court date. During Covid Lockdown. After Erika dumped me, i made friends with a girl after [Muna Ahmed died](https://www.wagesfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Muna-Ahmed/obituary). [Normani](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/normani-kordei-cyber-bullied-twitter) she was of age we went on a [date](https://honeybubbletea.kwickmenu.com/). I was on Instagram as ClarkGabl3 but changed the screename to DeeLoveBomr bc i was wrioting graffiti an the word `LOVER` and did not think Clark Gable real life should be mixed up with mine at all! So I asked Dr_Pirrat if she wrote graffiti. Bc all the young ppl at JPL have this life online, its strange, I got excluded from my demographic bc i had a child. Now i cant mingle and hanging out with you old people dont seem to be doing much but getting me hurt like them strippers. U cant be close to every one, i work with you, and i put my hannds on that girl [Normani](https://www.tiktok.com/@normani?lang=en) and there is a huge population in Atlanta that will freak the fuck out! If I leave her alone inLos Angeles! I want to work and be acknowledged! im about to miss my meal.. I will write mre later. I want to hear the discourses on EcoStress so bad. But its just [BadTiming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i77qbwimO1w)
